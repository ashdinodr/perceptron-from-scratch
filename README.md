# Writing a Perceptron classifier from scratch
The Perceptron is a simple classification algorithm suitable for problems in which classes are linearly separable in feature space. Let's code a single-layer Perceptron classifier from scratch, in Python. The Perceptron classification algorithm is implemented using two different numerical solvers (or ways to train the model): the Perceptron Learning Rule and Stochastic Gradient Descent.

The project workflow includes a visualization of the decision boundary built with the Perceptron algorithm, as well as a performance comparison with exemplary binary classifiers from scikit-learn.
