# Writing a Perceptron classifier from scratch
The Perceptron is a simple classification algorithm suitable for problems in which classes are linearly separable in feature space. Let's code a Perceptron classifier from scratch, in Python. The Perceptron algorithm will allow for the choice of two different numerical solvers (or ways to train the model).

The project workflow includes a visualization of the decision boundary built with the Perceptron algorithm, as well as a performance comparison with exemplary binary classifiers from scikit-learn.
